        <p>ðŸŽ‰ <strong>Welcome to Checkers Extravaganza!</strong> ðŸŽ‰</p>
        <p>
          Get ready for an epic duel of wits and strategy. Gather your friends
          and family for a face-off in this classic 2-player game.
        </p>

        <h3>Playing the Game</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            ðŸ”´ <strong>Player 1 - The Red Ruler:</strong><br />
            Command your crimson troops! Move your pieces diagonally downward,
            charging towards victory.
          </li>
          <li>
            âš« <strong>Player 2 - The Black Baron:</strong><br />
            Lead your obsidian army upwards, moving with precision and grace.
          </li>
          <li>
            ðŸ‘‘ <strong>King Me!</strong><br />
            Reach the opposite end, and watch your piece ascend to royalty,
            gaining the power to move freely in both directions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Capturing Opponents</h3>
        <p>
          Leap over your rival's pieces diagonally, claiming them as your own.
          Found an empty square after your jump? Look around; another opponent
          might be waiting to be conquered! In the heat of a multi-jump, the
          game will guide you towards your next victory jump.
        </p>

        <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
        <p>
          Remember, the game isn't over until one player captures all the pieces
          of the other. Strategy is key!
        </p>

        <h3>Need a Break?</h3>
        <p>
          Hit the restart button anytime. Have fun and may the best strategist
          win! ðŸ¥³
